# Rapptr Labs iOS Test

Thank you for letting me take this coding assessment!

I removed the Objective-C code and replaced it with Swift, so this is an 100% Swift project.

I opted to integrate Swift Package Manager because I have found it to be more stable and easier to integrate than Cocopods. 
I also integrated [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) SPM, a pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web.
