# Rapptr Labs iOS Test

Thank you for letting me take this coding assessment!
I removed the Objective-C code and replaced it with Swift, so this is an 100% Swift project.
I also opted to integrate Swift Package Manager because I have found it ais more stable and easier to integrate than Cocopods. 
I integrated [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) SPM, https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher.
